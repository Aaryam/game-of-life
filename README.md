# The Game of Life

Simple web-game with little to no graphics kinda like a text adventure where you can basically choose what you do every year.
You can do good things like save a cat from a tree.
You can do bad things like steal a purse from an old lady.
Each of these actions have an effect on a stat called "Reputation".
The higher your reputation (on either side, positive or negative), the more things you can do in the respective side.
For example, if I commit a robbery successfully, I may be able to do a bank robbery in the future.

Every action taken by the player has an amount of randomness to it.
Doing bad can get you caught, doing good has a chance to backfire.

This is the Game of Life.
